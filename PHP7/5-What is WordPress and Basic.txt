What is WordPress

WordPress is a publishing platform that makes it easy for anyone to publish online, and proudly powers millions of websites. It comes in two flavors: the fully hosted WordPress.com, and the self-hosted version, whose software is available for free at WordPress.org.

WordPress comes with two types of default content: Posts and Pages. In this video we introduce these two types of content and discuss their similarity and differences:

Pages: Pages in WordPress are what are referred to as static content, meaning that the content generally lives in one specific place on the site with its own URL. Pages can be edited and updated, but they are not generally changed too much once they are created. Pages are hierarchical, meaning that they can have a parent, child relationship where one main page has several sub-pages. This relationship is often reflected in drop down menus. Examples of pages can include things like an about page, a contact page, or a services page.

Post:  Posts on the other hand, are what are referred to as dynamic content, meaning that they are published regularly and often appear on different places throughout a site. For example, information about posts could exist on a main blog page, in sidebar widgets, as well as in other places like the footer or somewhere on the home page. Posts can be grouped using categories and tags, which help identify common topics and details that connect or identify posts. Posts are generally used for a blog or news section of a site.

Categories in WordPress: 
1, Hige level:  Categories are high level, generic ways of grouping posts and tags are specific, more unique ways of identifying topics the post relates to.
2, 2~ 8 categories per site
3, Posts require at least 1 category

Tags:
