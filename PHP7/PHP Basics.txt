PHP Basics

* Conservative estimate about 25% webpage built on PHP 
* Initiallu, PHP is an abbrivation of Personal home page tools, in 1995 it was released to the world. Later it changed to a new language still called PHP, now stands for PHP hypertext preprocessor.
* PHP is a server side language: the code is processed on the web's server; the server receives a request from a client, and processes that script on the server, and then returns the result as an HTML response to the client.


****************************************************************************
Dealing with Errors:
1. Log and report the Error
2. Display the Error
3. Act on the Error
3. Act on the Error
4. Ignore the Error (Avoid)

Types of Errors
1. Notice: will not stop the execution of the script. An example of a notice would be when you try to access an undefined variable
2. Warning:  As with Notice errors, Warning errors will not stop execution of the script. For example: trying to include a file that is missing, or calling a function with the incorrect number of parameters would each produce a warning.
3. Fatal Error: Fatal errors are caused when PHP encounters a logical error. There is no issue with the syntax and the script is readable, however, what you’re asking the script to do can't be done. For example: Dividing by zero, trying to access a function that doesn’t exist


There are different locations where we can control what error types are to be reported:
In the php.ini file
In the .htaccess file on your web server
From your own PHP code.

***********************************
In php.ini file:
error_reporting: Set the error reporting level. The default value is: “E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE,” meaning this this would should all error levels except E_NOTICE. For a development server you probably want to turn everything on by just using E_ALL.
display_errors: Set it to “ON” (default is “OFF”)if errors are to be printed to the screen.
log_errors: This indicates whether or not error logging should be done; default value is “on.”
error_log string: Sets the name of the file where script errors should be logged
+
html_errors: 
display_startup_errors: For debugging, you can also turn on errors that occur during PHP's startup sequence


.htaccess

setting in PHP file:
ini_set("log_errors", 1);
ini_set("error_log", "php-error.txt");

equals: (.htaccess)

# log errors
php_value log_errors 1

# log file for errors
php_value error_log php-error.txt

equals:(php.ini)
log_errors = On
error_log = "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/php-error.txt"

***************************************************************************
PHP Comments

Single Line:
	# this is a comment line
	// this is a comment line
	/* this is a comment line */
Multiline:
	//first line
	//second line
	
	/*
	first line
	second line
	*/
	
Doc lock comments:
	/**
	  * This file is our first hello world
	  * @author: YY
	  */

	  
*******************************************************************************
PHP Variables

Scalar(Base) Types:
boolean    true/false
integer
float
string

Compound Types:
Array
Object

Special types:
resource
NULL

********************

Integer:

var_dump(): This function displays structured information about one or more expressions that includes its type and value. Arrays and objects are explored recursively with values indented to show structure.

gettype(): Returns the type of the PHP variable var. For type checking, use is_* functions.
	is_int()
	is_float()
	is_bool()
	is_string()

*******************
float:

$a = 1.234; 
$b = 1.2e3; 
$c = 7E-10;

*******************
Operators:

                Arithmetic Operators
Example	   Name	                        Result
+$a	     Identity	      Conversion of $a to int or float as appropriate.
-$a	     Negation	      Opposite of $a.
$a + $b	 Addition	      Sum of $a and $b.
$a - $b	 Subtraction	  Difference of $a and $b.
$a * $b	 Multiplication	  Product of $a and $b.
$a / $b	 Division	      Quotient of $a and $b.
$a % $b	 Modulo	Remainder of $a divided by $b.
$a ** $b Exponentiation	  Result of raising $a to the $b'th power. Introduced in PHP 5.6.


		Incermental/Decremental Operators
++$a     Pre-incrememt    Increment $a by one, then retuern $a
$a++     Post-increment   Return $a, then incrememt $a by one
--$a     Pre-decrement    Decrement $a by one, then return  $a
$a--     Post-decrement   Return $a, then decrement $a by one

******************

String:

single quoted string

double quoted string let you place variables in the string.

	eg:
	echo "demonstration of double quoted string: $str_1 and $num_one and $flt";

	display as following:
	demonstration of double quoted string: string 1 and 1 and 1200

Heredoc string:(<<<)

	eg:
	
	$name = 'Alena';

	$myString = <<<EOT
	Example of string
	spanning multiple lines
		using spaces
	and including a $name variable
	using heredoc syntax.
	EOT;

	would output:
	Example of string
	spanning multiple lines
		using spaces
	and including a Alena variable
	using heredoc syntax.

	
Nowdoc Strings:
Nowdocs are to single-quoted strings what heredocs are to double-quoted strings. A nowdoc is specified similarly to a heredoc, but no parsing is done inside a nowdoc.

	eg.:
	$name = 'Alena';

	$str = <<<'EOT'
	Example of string
	spanning multiple lines
		using spaces
	and including a $name variable
	using nowdoc syntax.
	EOT;

	would output:
	Example of string
	spanning multiple lines
		using spaces
	and including a $name variable
	using nowdoc syntax.

	
************************

Escape Characters:
'\' will tell the PHP interpreter that the next character will be treated specially

Which escape sequence can be used within a single quoted string?   (\')

**********************
Concatenation:
""     Single variable  $myString = "***********";
.      Single line      $myString = 'Combine multiple'. $strings. 'on one string';
.=     Multiline        $myString.= 'Combine multiple';
						$myString.= $strings;
						$myString.= 'on one string';
						
**********************
Boolean:

var_dump((bool) "");        // bool(false)
var_dump((bool) 0);        // bool(false)
var_dump((bool) 1);         // bool(true)
var_dump((bool) -2);        // bool(true)
var_dump((bool) "foo");     // bool(true)
var_dump((bool) 2.3e5);     // bool(true)
var_dump((bool) array(12)); // bool(true)
var_dump((bool) array());   // bool(false)
var_dump((bool) "false");   // bool(true)


PHP Framework Interop Group (PHP-FIG) is a group of established PHP projects whose goal is to talk about commonalities between our projects and find ways we can work better together.

PHP Standards Recommendations (PSR-2) intent is to reduce cognitive friction when scanning code from different authors. It does so by enumerating a shared set of rules and expectations about how to format PHP code.

PHP keywords MUST be in lower case.
The PHP constants true, false, and null MUST be in lower case.
