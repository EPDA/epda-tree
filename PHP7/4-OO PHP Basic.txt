What is Object-Oriented Programming

Class: methods and properties
Object: instance of Object

1, a programming paradigm is a style or way of approaching problem to come up with a solution. Two main paradigms in PHP are procedual and OOP
2, No one programming paradigm can solve every programming problem
3, Bad spaghetti code that weaves all over your application and is complicated to follow can be written in any paradigm, incliding OOP.
   Follow two tenets of programming: 1, dry principle(don't repeat yourself); 2, KISS principle(keep it simple, stupid)

Why OOP?
1, Modularity
2, Reusability
3, Maintainable
4, Scalability
5, Framework (PHP frameworks:Laravel, Symphony and Zend)
6, Contribute to open source software
7, Give you various ways to think and solve problems
8, More easiler translate your programming skills into other OOP languages
9, Become a more valuable developer

Classes and Objects

1, typically only one class per file
2, The file name is the same as the class name
3, All class files are stored within a 'classes' folder


Access modifiersï¼š 
	public: Publicly accessible for anywhere, even from outside the scope of class
	private: Accessed within the class itself.
	protected: Same as private, except by allowing child(sub) classes to access protected parent(super) properties and methods.
	
Object-Operators:
->: Note the property name does not start with $ sign, only the object name start with $. Beacuse this entire reference is one variable

Associative Arrays

Typoe Casting:
Type casting in PHP works much as it does in C: the name of the desired type is written in parentheses before the variable which is to be cast.

<?php
$foo = 10;   // $foo is an integer
$bar = (boolean) $foo;   // $bar is a boolean
?>
The casts allowed are:

(int), (integer) - cast to integer
(bool), (boolean) - cast to boolean
(float), (double), (real) - cast to float
(string) - cast to string
(array) - cast to array
(object) - cast to object
(unset) - cast to NULL

Some functions:

explode(http://php.net/explode):  from string to array

implode (http://php.net/implode) :from array to string

trim
ltrim
rtrim
